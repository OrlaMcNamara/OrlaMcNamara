Hello
Mon - At 10:00, we were given an introduction to Red Hat by James and a tour of the office by Becky. We then took part in an ice breaker activity involving ______. After setting up a GIThub account, downloading VS Code on the laptops and lunch, there was a GIT workshop run by Jennefer in which we were introduced to the basics of GIT and GIThub. Git is a widely utilised open-source system used by developers for programming, put very simply. I found this day to be very interesting as i was able to meet new people and learn new things in a new environment. This continued until the day end at 5:00.

After that James talked to us about his experience in Red Hat and working as a software engineer and manager. After lunch, Daniel Lawton talked to us about student life in the SETU computer science course. It was interesting to hear about how
